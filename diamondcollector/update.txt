 -Please leave feedback (the link in the top corner) on what you want to see in the game and what things
  that should be balanced. 
	- Would you like a 2D-minigame instead of clicking a rock for manual mining? This is almost ready to launch today.
	- Should the experienceworkers cost more and more money instead of a static value?
        - We need feedback to improve! Shoot! :D
 -Updated performance again.

2016-03-07
 -Added more clicking-power craftables as some feedback is related to clicks beeing underpowered at higher levels. Will also add % upgrades later on.
 -Added a small tutorial for new player, if the game can't locate a savefile a popup will show that asks if the player wants to see a tutorial :)
 -Adding more workforce upgrades, prices are totaly random and will be balanced out later on.
 -Added a automatic-seller craftable which is activated on the inventory-page. Sells selected amount of ores every 6 second. Added this if your saving up for something and want to keep track of your money.
 -Added a new crafting category (workforce) here upgrades can be upgraded. (missing pictures so hover over them too se what it is for now).

 -Removed new tooltips because Safari users could not use crafting with it enabled. (will try to fix the bug and reenable them).
 -Decreased droprates of almost all ores, hopefully the game is reaching a more balanced state now.
 -New upgrade, SpaceSettlement! Something for you guys to reach for while im working on more crafting to create fun challenges.
 -Fixed bug that appeared when farming for a while and selling all ores, ores in the 100k+ did not sell correctly and hopefully this is working as intended now.
 -Added new tooltip for crafting and pictures. There may be pictures missing because of the cache. In chrome press F12 and then right-click the refresh button and choose clear cache to force clearing of cache. :)

2016-03-05
 -Fixed bug that made new players to the game not save correctly.

2016-03-04
 -Added Droprate talent icon.
 -Changed implementation of dropRate-bonus talent, were adding 0.5% to all ore rather than increasing it by 0.5%. This was very OP and diamond was too easy to get. May alter the percentage later when this fix is tried out.
